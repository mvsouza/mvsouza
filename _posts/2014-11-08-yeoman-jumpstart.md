##What'a hell?
You may not know about the existence of Yeoman, as I didn't. So in that case you are asking yourself "what the F$%# is this?".
Yeoman is scaffolding tool that helps developers to start up their projects, especially client side kind in webapps. It genatera boilerplate code includding bower and npm package references and task runner scripts grunt or gulp. 
##And? Should I care about it?
Actualy this is pretty nite, because you can easily set up a project with hole of structurer.
It has a huge set of generators of a vaiarity of projects, which depending on the propose of 
may have tasks like autometed tests, build, watch (livereload), and bower packages.
